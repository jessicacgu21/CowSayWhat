# CowSayWhat
I wanted to make something from my favorite unix command cowsay | lolcat and I was really fond of the Charizard cowfile. So when a user types and submits its message, the message shows up in a Charizard that's in rainbow color. (If you don't like Charizard, you can press Recombobulate and change your avatar.) 

You'll need to have cowsay installed and jmorin's cowfiles (found at https://github.com/jmorin/cowfiles).
